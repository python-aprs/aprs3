# aprs3 TODO

The following features are possible or on the roadmap, but not yet being implemented.

# Decode/Encode

## Position Reports

### Position ambiguity

### DF reports

The report contains the DF symbol (i.e. the Symbol Table ID is / and the Symbol Code is \).
I don't really see these being used much on the air, so the implementation is deferred.

### Maidenhead grid beacon (obsolete)

### Raw NMEA sentence (find external parser)

### Compressed position

### Mic-E encoded

### Weather Reports

## Telemetry Data

## Object / Item Reports

## Station Capability / Query

## Status Report

## User-defined packets
